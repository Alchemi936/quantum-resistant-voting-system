# quantum-resistant-voting-system

## Overview

The Quantum-Resistant Blockchain Voting System is designed to provide a secure, private, and tamper-proof voting process using advanced quantum-resistant encryption techniques. This system ensures that votes are counted accurately and securely, leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent election process.

### Features

- **Quantum-Resistant Encryption:** Uses state-of-the-art encryption algorithms to protect against quantum threats.
- **Decentralized Voting:** Ensures transparency and tamper-proof operations.
- **Secure and Private:** Votes are encrypted and verified using cutting-edge cryptographic methods.

## Technologies

- **Smart Contracts:** Written in [Rust/Motoko] for deployment on the Internet Computer (ICP).
- **Frontend:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend:** Node.js for user registration and authentication.
- **Quantum-Resistant Encryption Algorithms:** Implementations of lattice-based encryption, hash-based cryptography, and code-based encryption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or higher)
- [DFX](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/quickstart.html)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) (for Ethereum local testing)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) (for Ethereum smart contract development)

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/quantum-resistant-voting-system.git
   cd quantum-resistant-voting-system

2.  Install Dependencies:

For the Node.js backend:

cd backend
npm install

For the frontend:

cd frontend
npm install

For ICP development:

dfx new quantum_voting_system


3. Set Up Ganache (for Ethereum testing):

Start Ganache:
ganache-cli

Deploy Smart Contracts (for Ethereum testing):
Compile and migrate contracts:

truffle compile
truffle migrate --network development


Development
User Registration Module:

The Node.js server handles user registration and authentication.
Routes are set up in server.js for user registration and login.
Voting Module:

Implemented using Rust/Motoko on the ICP.
Quantum-resistant encryption algorithms are integrated to secure votes.
Frontend Development:

Connects to the backend and ICP canisters for interacting with the voting system.
Testing

Unit Tests: Use Truffle and Mocha for smart contract testing.
Integration Tests: Ensure the integration between the frontend, backend, and blockchain works seamlessly.
Manual Testing: Deploy on ICP and manually verify voting functionalities.

Deployment
1.Deploy Canisters on ICP:
dfx deploy

2.Deploy Frontend:
Update the frontend configuration to point to the deployed ICP canisters.

Future Enhancements
Integration with Internet Identity for secure user authentication.
Enhancements in quantum-resistant algorithms based on emerging research.
Expansion of voting modules to support various types of elections.
